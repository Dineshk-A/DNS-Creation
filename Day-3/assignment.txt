Day 3: Configuring Reverse Lookup Zone

1. Create a reverse lookup zone for the IP range in use.
2. Add PTR (Pointer) records to link IPs with hostnames.
3. Set up and configure zone properties like aging and scavenging.
4. Test reverse DNS lookups with `nslookup`.
5. Verify settings by querying IPs to resolve hostnames.
